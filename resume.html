      <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>Production Assistant</h3>
        <h4>D.C. Bureau, Gray Television</h4>
        <h5>(June 2023 – present)</h5>
            <p>I arrange and conduct interviews with lawmakers and experts on and around Capitol Hill and assist reporters on shoots. I write and edit content from SOT/VOs to video packages to longer investigative stories to be aired nationally. I research and write in-depth memos on stories for reference by reporters and producers. I was in charge of the full edit on stories “New survey shows the cost of identity theft in Black communities” and “How to spot misleading ads and subscription traps for weight loss products,” both of which aired across Gray Television stations nationwide.</p>
        <h3>Intern</h3>
        <h4>Local News Live, Gray Television</h4>
        <h5>(June 2023 – September 2023)</h5>
            <p>I pitched and wrote breaking news scripts every day for national broadcasts. I wrote and operated lower-third headlines for live news shows under deadline. I contributed to social media on LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook and compiled research for anchors to refer to on air during breaking news.</p>
        <h3>Intern</h3>
        <h4>Video Production Department, University of Maryland</h4>
        <h5>(January 2023 – May 2023)</h5>
            <p>I shot video using broadcast and DSLR cameras and edited projects on deadline for wider use by the university. I collaborated with the supervising team to produce multiple video projects each month and led the team’s edit of a college admission announcement video. I volunteered at the Washington Press Club Foundation’s annual dinner, the White House News Photographers’ Association awards, and twice at the National Capital Emmy Awards. I volunteered at the National Press Photographers’ Association’s News Video Workshop to hone my video storytelling skills and help the workshop run smoothly.</p>
