                    <p>Some background on the “fight,” before diving in:</p>
                    <p>
                        At the New York Mets home opening game Friday, March 24,
                        second baseman Jeff McNeil had a tense exchange with
                        Milwaukee Brewers first baseman Rhys Hoskins. Rhys
                        Hoskins, a longtime Philadelphia Phillies player,
                        already had a history of tension with McNeil. This time,
                        it erupted after Hoskins slid hard as he ran to second
                        base, trying to break up a double play being turned by
                        McNeil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hoskins’ slide knocked over McNeil, who blew up at the
                        runner, yelling at him and continuing to vent his anger
                        after the play. Benches cleared and both teams streamed
                        onto the field, but they stayed separated by the
                        baseball diamond as McNeil yelled at Hoskins across the
                        field. Hoskins looked mostly bewildered, and the Mets
                        challenged the slide for legality. When umpires reviewed
                        the slide and it played on the big screen, McNeil went
                        off again, cursing, and Hoskins made a crybaby gesture
                        from the dugout and looked unbothered, if confused, at
                        the intense reaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If that was it, this wouldn’t be much of a story. But it
                        wasn’t. The next day, Mets pitcher Yohan Ramirez
                        responded with a 94 mph fastball thrown behind Hoskins.
                        It’s an intimidation tactic used in baseball as
                        retribution, and umpires thought it was intentional
                        enough to throw Ramirez out of the game immediately.

                        This part kind of really made me think, “wait what?”
                        Because they watched the replay and then McNeil turns
                        after watching the replay and he says, “you think that's
                        [expletive] okay?” and you can see Rhys is like, “yeah?”

                    <p class="pull-quote">
                        So there's just a disconnect between what's a good
                        slide, what's a bad slide, what's allowed, what's not
                        allowed, what's dirty, what's not dirty, what's
                        aggressive and competitive and what's dirty.

                    <p>
                        And McNeil seems to think that anything aggressive and
                        competitive is dirty, because a lot of MLB players that
                        I reached out to Trevor Plouffe who does “Talking
                        Baseball,” and then he reached out to other guys [who
                        said] that's not dirty it's aggressive. It was late but
                        he's trying to break up the double play within the rules
                        of the game and didn't get anyone injured. Dallas Braden
                        tweeted out, “Dude learn to move your feet around the
                        bag, you’re just planted there.”

                        I'm just going to give you the rabbit hole that I went
                        down in chronological order. Number one: this picture
                        was flying around the internet from Braves fans, saying,
                        “Oh McNeil's done a dirty slide too, look at this slide
                        he's way offline, out of the base path!” So I said all
                        right, let's go find that play, I want to see if this is
                        just a screenshot or is that really a dirty play.

                        So I pulled up the play and here it is. [Daniel]
                        Vogelbach hits it to second, McNeil slides and they run
                        into each other. It's not dirty. He’s really just
                        sliding way early. If you want to say the cut off of the
                        grass right there, that's kind of early or late as just
                        an easy way to gauge. If you slide after that it's a
                        little late aggressive, if you slide before that you're
                        giving yourself up. Because he's not really trying to
                        get to the bag there, I think he didn't realize the the
                        short stop was going to come into him, so I didn't think
                        that was dirty. It ended up helping, but I didn't think
                        that was dirty on McNeil's part to his credit. Now where
                        things got weird is I went and I was like, well let's
                        see if McNeil has any dirty slides.

                        So as you can see, he doesn't try to break up the Double
                        Play. It's almost like it's not an option in his head. I
                        watched 160 instances in his career and I had to cut a
                        lot down because this got too long.

                        What was that? You know? What was that one? If I go
                        backwards here, when I was finding these, there were
                        some like that, where he just runs straight through.
                        Doesn’t slide at all, he never really tries to slide and
                        get to the bag, he's not really trying to get in the
                        way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So that was really weird to me. And kind of eye-opening.
                        Oh, he's very respectful, so he thinks that you
                        shouldn't try to break up double plays. Then I was like
                        okay, let's go watch what Rhys Hoskins does — who's
                        slower than McNeil.

                    <p>
                        And McNeil has this reputation as a blue-collar grinder,
                        tough player, so that kind of really surprised me to see
                        all of that. I went to Rhys Hoskins who's slower, I
                        think 20%. I think McNeil is 50% in sprint speed and
                        Hoskins is like 25 [percent].

                        So as you can see, what Hoskins does is he gets his ass
                        down the line quick, when he gets to that cutoff point
                        that I was talking about, he gets big like a bear, like
                        you're trying to scare a bear, “Ahhhh,” you know, throws
                        his hands up gets kind of upright with his chest. Then
                        drops down into the base and as you can see on these
                        highlights, he induces a lot of bad throws and breaks up
                        the double play.

                        where he's inducing bad throws, putting pressure on the

                        Something to note if you're not a baseball fan as Jomboy
                        says "I'm not going to be safe here," is the structure
                        of double plays. In this case, there is a runner on
                        first base, which means when the batter hits the ball
                        and they run to first, the runner on first is *forced*
                        to run to second. To "turn" a double play, a fielder is
                        throwing the ball to get that runner out at second base,
                        then *turning* with the ball and throwing immediately to
                        first base to try and get the batter out before they
                        reach first. The runner running to second base knows
                        they are likely to be out, as Jomboy said referring to
                        Hoskins, but they can still use techniques described in
                        this deep dive to try to "break up" the double play.

                        McNeil was the complete opposite. He was granting people
                        double plays. I was very confused, I was like this is
                        odd. I have so many more of these from McNeil see, I

                        Rhys breaks up a lot of double plays by using his big

                        hurt anyone, it's just that's it's still part of the

                        A very similar play, Rhys is already in frame and he's
                        sliding. He’s not going down until he hits that cut off
                        point of the grass. Whereas McNeil is giving himself up
                        way early, has no interest in being part of the play,
                        and just says there you go, go ahead turn it. So that

                            are tied at zero in the bottom of the fourth inning,
                            bases loaded. Down below, the Mets are up two in the

                        that's when the ball hits the bat. So ball hits the bat,
                        I sync that up, and then the ball is hit to the
                        shortstop.

                        And as they flip it to the second baseman, you can see
                        Rhys Hoskins is in frame and he's about to get big on
                        him like a bear and then drop down to make it hard. And
                        McNeil just comes into frame now and has no interest in
                        playing competitive baseball on this play, just gives
                        himself up and makes it easy.

                        I was like, that's crazy. Then I wanted to make sure
                        people didn't think I was cherry-picking a bajillion, so
                        I put two Rhys Hoskins on the right and eight McNeil on
                        the left, and again, this point where the blue marker is
                        on my timeline is when the bat hits the ball.

                        And if you watch through to when Rhys gets to the bag
                        he's by the cut on the two on the right already and
                        McNeil is nowhere in frame on the bottom four and on the
                        top four he's going down already and not really trying

                        sent videos to some players that I know and talk to and

                        Then I had to dig deeper because I was watching the Mets
                        game last night and Lindor, on a double play ball, ran
                        through the bag. And then the announcers kind of talked
                        about the strategy to that. It was a double play to end
                        the first inning. Lindor just runs through the bag and
                        they explain why here.

                        that Lindor does not slide there. This is something that
                        is relatively new in the game, where players are being
                        instructed to do this. Yes, and the idea is that if they
                        don't get the out there, they have to go tag and the
                        running from third is going to score.”

                        Okay, if they don't get the out, they have to go tag him
                        and the runner on third will score. So if they don't get
                        the out at second, so if the fielder… what? If the
                        fielder botches the — if the fielder misses the bag with
                        his foot? That’s what they're preparing for? There’s
                        runners on first and second, so they're saying don't try
                        to slide and make this [competitive]. What?

                    <p>
                        Okay, standard strategy would be, hey, try to do a late
                        slide and make this dude uncomfortable turning this
                        double play, within the rules and without injuring him.
                        And if he throws the ball away, the runner that started
                        on second that's at third, rounding third right now,
                        will score on a bad throw. So force a bad throw or make
                        him so uncomfortable he doesn't want to throw it away
                        and he eats the play and doesn't turn two.

                        That means standard strategy to break up a double play
                        would be to get big "like a bear," as Hoskins
                        demonstrates, in hopes of messing up the throw to first
                        base or "eating" the play, which is to abandon the
                        throwing attempt altogether.

                        players] to casually jog through the base in case this
                        dude's [the second baseman’s] foot isn't on the bag, so
                        then he would turn around and go tag Lindor. And while
                        he's doing that the runner on third will score. That’s
                        crazy weird.

                        So I watched this last night. I was like wait, what are
                        you doing? What’s happening? Then I went back into the
                        deep dives and I found all the other Mets players last
                        year that kind of have speed and should be hustling and
                        breaking up double plays. And I searched for instances
                        when they would be tasked to make the dude uncomfortable
                        to throw it, so here's what I found:

                        There's not a runner on second that could be rounding
                        third in this one, so that strategy doesn't even make
                        sense — even though it doesn't make sense already. This
                        is a tied game in the third inning and instead of trying
                        to make break up the double play…

                        They said they never noticed this. [Pete} Alonso and

                        That is the same as the Rhys Hoskin slide, you know,
                        good job by Pete. He’s at the cut of the grass, he's
                        getting down late, he's throwing his arms up, he's
                        trying to make them uncomfortable. Here’s Alonzo again,
                        look at this. Nice. So some guys, I guess, aren't
                        listening to whoever's telling them to not do this.
                        Here’s Canha and he's playing hard. He does not want
                        them to turn this. Look at that slide, you know, and he
                        gets the player here, Oswaldo, and that's legal. That’s
                        fair. Oswaldo has got to move his feet; you’ve got to
                        come through the bag, you can't just stand on the bag.
                        So Alonzo and Canha, great stuff.

                            they don't get down the line, they're not going to.
                            There’s guys that might be injured or hurting or the
                            game's lopsided, but in most cases when it's a close
                            game and you have a double play ball, guys are
                            trying to break up the double play. They’re trying
                            to slide late, make that fielder uncomfortable
                            within the rules of the law and break up the double
                            play.

                            So that at least saved my soul a little bit. But I
                            don't know what's going on in Queens! It seems like
                            they're instructed — I think maybe they have the
                            rule wrong. So I will post a

                                There’s zero outs or one out — so you need two

                                And then just because you get 200 options, to
                                find better ones or to even limit it a little
                                more, I did batting score difference: three runs
                                — so it's a three-run game
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                And then I did the exit velo on the ball: 80 mph
                                to 95 miles per hour — because if it's over 95
                                they're going to turn that so fast that the
                                runner doesn't really have time to get down
                                there. But anywhere between 80 and 95, that's a
                                double play ball where the runner has time, with
                                a lead, to go make something happen, break it up
                            </li>

                                Then all you got to do is change the team. So

                            The only warning I'll give is: [Seattle] Mariners,
                            you guys were very similar to the Mets, but I think
                            it's mostly Eugenio Suárez from last year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But man, go to the [Los Angeles] Angels who last
                            year were — well, they were in it for a while, and
                            then in the last two months they weren't. They had
                            17 instances because we really dwindled it down, and
                            if you just watch a bunch of theirs I'll pop them
                            all out and we'll just watch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So you guys can see, if you want to do this at home,
                            this is how you do it: just hold option or command,
                            open new tab, and then just skip ahead to the ball…
                            and… got down. Threw the hands up. Tried to break it
                            up. Yep, hands up at the cut, trying to get down,
                            very normal. Here we go, right there, hands up,
                            sliding late, trying to break it up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So Angels fans if you tuned in, you got other
                            problems you care about, but this isn't one.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is what I did all last night, I just checked
                            every team to figure out — I just didn't want to
                            make a video about the Mets and have it be
                            widespread around the league. But if you do this
                            same search and you find the Mets… it hurts my
                            baseball soul. You know? Look at this.

                            break up the double play or do they tell people to
                            run away and not try to make anyone uncomfortable
                            and just give up and say, “Oh you guys want to turn

                            slide in the vicinity of the bag, maintain contact
                            with the bag, and you're fine. Rhys's slide was a

                            back to the Premiere video of it — the reason it
                            looks dirty is because McNeil bobbles this ball.

                            Also, McNeil just stands on top of the bag because I
                            think he thinks you can't do this. But you can.
                            You’re supposed to run through it. A lot of times
                            you see the second baseman run through the bag,
                            catch it, and move their body forward with momentum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now this throw wasn't great and then he drops the
                            transfer, so instead of watching out for the runner,
                            he's worried about the ball, maybe. But he's just
                            planted. Normally he throws that and that back leg
                            comes up and that's what happens when Rhys goes
                            down.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead, the back leg stays down because he didn't
                            throw it. Think about a throwing motion; that leg
                            would swing forward and he'd be on the other side of
                            the bag.

                            He's saying the reason Hoskins collided with McNeil
                            is because usually when turning a double play, the
                            second baseman's leg lifts up and out of the way
                            with the momentum from the follow-through of the
                            throw. McNeil's foot was in the way because he
                            bobbled the ball and never had a chance to throw it,
                            so he never had a chance for his foot to lift on the
                            follow-through.

                            Rhys doesn't know he's going to bobble the ball. He
                            bobbles the ball.

                        <p>
                            A lot of people said that Rhys cleated him, and I
                            was like, what do you mean? The spikes weren't that
                            up. They’re the same level as the foot. Spikes up
                            [would] get him in the shin. And in some of videos
                            showed earlier, they did have spikes up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And then it is awkward that he lands on the other
                            foot, but again, at the time Rhys goes down he
                            doesn't know McNeil going to bobble this ball and
                            stay planted with both legs. He thinks he's going to
                            throw the ball and end up over here.

                            So it ends up — it's bad and it doesn't look good,
                            but it's mostly incidental and it's still a legal
                            slide. I just think the Mets have been told that
                            those slides are illegal and that's why we had this
                            confusion: “You think that's [ __ ] okay?” “You're
                            allowed to slide, what's wrong with that?”
