                    <h3>A note before reading: </h3>
                    <p>The text is pulled directly from a YouTube video by user Jomboy Media from the show “Talkin’ Baseball”. I edited out some filler words (like, um, you know), changed formatting, and added notes for clarity. Otherwise, though, it is written as it was said in the video, rather than in standard journalistic syntax. However, since it is a roughtly 4,000 word transcript, I will not be putting quotation marks around each line said in the video. Instead, they will be styled differently to be easily differentiated.</p>
                    <p>Some background on the “fight,” before we get into it: </p>
                    <p>At the New York Mets home opening game Friday, March 24, second baseman Jeff McNeil had a tense exchange with Milwaukee Brewers first baseman Rhys Hoskins. Rhys Hoskins, a longtime Philadelphia Phillies player, already had a history of tension with McNeil. This time, it erupted after Hoskins slid hard as he ran to second base, trying to break up a double play being turned by McNeil. </p>
                    <p>Hoskins’ slide knocked over McNeil, who blew up at the runner, yelling at him and continuing to vent his anger after the play. Benches cleared and both teams streamed onto the field, but they stayed separated by the baseball diamond as McNeil yelled at Hoskins across the field. Hoskins looked mostly bewildered, and the Mets challenged the slide for legality. When umpires reviewed the slide and it played on the big screen, McNeil went off again, cursing, and Hoskins made a crybaby gesture from the dugout and looked unbothered, if confused, at the intense reaction. </p>
                    <p>If that was it, this wouldn’t be much of a story. But it wasn’t. The next day, Mets pitcher Yohan Ramirez responded with a 94 mph fastball thrown behind Hoskins. It’s an intimidation tactic used in baseball as retribution, and umpires thought it was intentional enough to throw Ramirez out of the game immediately. </p>
                    <p>Now back to our regularly-scheduled programming...</p>
                </div>
                <div id="transcript" class="col-sm-8">
                    <p>Topic number one: McNeil and Rhys Hoskins: the fight. I did a breakdown on it. I was very interested in it in my breakdown.</p>

                <!-- Insert video of original replay here -->
                    <p>This part kind of really made me think, “wait what?” Because they watched the replay and then McNeil turns after watching the replay and he says, “you think that's [expletive] okay?” and you can see Rhys is like, “yeah?” </p>
                <!-- Insert pull quote -->
                    <p class="pull-quote">So there's just a disconnect between what's a good slide, what's a bad slide, what's allowed, what's not allowed, what's dirty, what's not dirty, what's aggressive and competitive and what's dirty.</p>
                    <p>And McNeil seems to think that anything aggressive and competitive is dirty, because a lot of MLB players that I reached out to Trevor Plouffe who does “Talking Baseball,” and then he reached out to other guys [who said] that's not dirty it's aggressive. It was late but he's trying to break up the double play within the rules of the game and didn't get anyone injured. Dallas Braden tweeted out, “Dude learn to move your feet around the bag, you’re just planted there.”</p>

                    <h2>Looking into McNeil’s “dirty” past slide</h2>
                </div>
                <div id="transcript" class="col-sm-8">
                    <p>I'm just going to give you the rabbit hole that I went down in chronological order. Number one: this picture was flying around the internet from Braves fans, saying, “Oh McNeil's done a dirty slide too, look at this slide he's way offline, out of the base path!” So I said all right, let's go find that play, I want to see if this is just a screenshot or is that really a dirty play.</p>
          <!-- Insert video of McNeil's slide here -->
                    <p>So I pulled up the play and here it is. [Daniel] Vogelbach hits it to second, McNeil slides and they run into each other. It's not dirty. He’s really just sliding way early. If you want to say the cut off of the grass right there, that's kind of early or late as just an easy way to gauge. If you slide after that it's a little late aggressive, if you slide before that you're giving yourself up. Because he's not really trying to get to the bag there, I think he didn't realize the the short stop was going to come into him, so I didn't think that was dirty. It ended up helping, but I didn't think that was dirty on McNeil's part to his credit. Now where things got weird is I went and I was like, well let's see if McNeil has any dirty slides.</p>

            <div class="row">

                    <h2>Going deeper:</h2>
                </div>
                <div id="transcript" class="col-sm-6">
                    <p>So I went and I searched...</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>...every time McNeil's been on first base and…</li>
                        <li>…there's less than two outs so the team is going to try and turn a double play and… </li>
                        <li>…there's a ground ball to the infield… </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>…and I wanted to see what that looks like. What I found kind of blew me away and I'll just show you all the videos I found.</p>
                    <p>What you're looking for as this plays is McNeil's the runner on first and how he tries to break up double plays. </p>
         <!-- Insert compilation video of McNeil's slides here -->
                    <p>So as you can see, he doesn't try to break up the Double Play. It's almost like it's not an option in his head. I watched 160 instances in his career and I had to cut a lot down because this got too long. </p>
                    <p>A lot of them look like this:</p>
        <!-- More compilation video here -->
                    <p>I mean he's not even — he's being considerate, he's being gentlemanly, he's saying, “hey I don't want to get in the way of what you guys were doing. You want to turn the double play, go ahead and turn it. Who am I to try to stop it?”</p>
        <!-- More compilation video here -->
                    <p>What was that? You know? What was that one? If I go backwards here, when I was finding these, there were some like that, where he just runs straight through. Doesn’t slide at all, he never really tries to slide and get to the bag, he's not really trying to get in the way. </p>
                    <p>So that was really weird to me. And kind of eye-opening. Oh, he's very respectful, so he thinks that you shouldn't try to break up double plays. Then I was like okay, let's go watch what Rhys Hoskins does — who's slower than McNeil. </p>
                    <p>And McNeil has this reputation as a blue-collar grinder, tough player, so that kind of really surprised me to see all of that. I went to Rhys Hoskins who's slower, I think 20%. I think McNeil is 50% in sprint speed and Hoskins is like 25 [percent]. </p>
                </div>
            <div class="row">

                    <h2>Hoskins analysis time: </h2>
                </div>
                <div id="transcript" class="col-sm-6">
                   <p>So here's every time Rhys Hoskins has...</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>...been on first base and...</li>
                        <li>...there's a grounder to the infield and...</li>
                        <li>...less than two outs so the team is going to try and turn and double play.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Here's how he attacks it: </p>
        <!-- Compilation of Hoskins' slides here -->
                    <p>So as you can see, what Hoskins does is he gets his ass down the line quick, when he gets to that cutoff point that I was talking about, he gets big like a bear, like you're trying to scare a bear, “Ahhhh,” you know, throws his hands up gets kind of upright with his chest. Then drops down into the base and as you can see on these highlights, he induces a lot of bad throws and breaks up the double play.</p>
                    <p class="pull-quote">He's never injured someone at second. </p>
        <!-- Video continues -->
                    <p>That's a good example of what he does.</p>
                    <p class="pull-quote">He’s never injured the player. There might be contact, but within the rules, and it's winning baseball. </p>
                    <p>I mean he's doing everything he can. He’s like, “hey I don't have speed so I'm not going to be safe here, let me try and do everything I can to play winning baseball,” and that's what he's doing. Again, I had to cut this down. There was just a lot of examples of this where he's inducing bad throws, putting pressure on the fielder, and it's working. </p>
                </div>
                <div id="authorsnote" class="col-sm-4">
                    <p>Something to note if you're not a baseball fan as Jomboy says "I'm not going to be safe here," is the structure of double plays. In this case, there is a runner on first base, which means when the batter hits the ball and they run to first, the runner on first is *forced* to run to second. To "turn" a double play, a fielder is throwing the ball to get that runner out at second base, then *turning* with the ball and throwing immediately to first base to try and get the batter out before they reach first. The runner running to second base knows they are likely to be out, as Jomboy said referring to Hoskins, but they can still use techniques described in this deep dive to try to "break up" the double play.</p>

                   <p>McNeil was the complete opposite. He was granting people double plays. I was very confused, I was like this is odd. I have so many more of these from McNeil see, I color-coded it.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Pink was to the short stop</li>
                        <li>Yellow was to the third baseman</li>
                        <li>Blue was to the second baseman</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <div id="authorsnote" class="col-sm-4">
                    <p>This means the ball was *hit* to the short stop, third baseman, or second baseman on each of these plays.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="transcript" class="col-sm-6">
                    <p>Rhys breaks up a lot of double plays by using his big body and getting to the bag down late. Again he's never hurt anyone, it's just that's it's still part of the game. </p>
                    <p class="pull-quote">The rules didn't make this not part of the game, but I'm beginning to think the Mets might think the rules made this not part of the game.</p>
                    <p>I kept digging. First I wanted to compare Rhys and McNeil. Again, McNeil is faster. Here's the ball hit to the short stop and flipped to second base. </p>
        <!-- Video compilation of Hoskins -->
                    <p>A very similar play, Rhys is already in frame and he's sliding. He’s not going down until he hits that cut off point of the grass. Whereas McNeil is giving himself up way early, has no interest in being part of the play, and just says there you go, go ahead turn it. So that was wild. </p>
                    <p>Then I said okay, </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>let me find one in a close game, because that's unfair if one game doesn't matter and the other game is really close. So up top, you have Phillies. They are tied at zero in the bottom of the fourth inning, bases loaded. Down below, the Mets are up two in the sixth inning. </li>
                        <li>I also wanted to find balls that were hit similar. </li>
                    </ol>
        <!-- comparison video compilation plays -->
                    <p>So if you see on my Premiere timeline, this blue marker, that's when the ball hits the bat. So ball hits the bat, I sync that up, and then the ball is hit to the shortstop.</p>
        <!-- comparison video compilation plays -->
                    <p>And as they flip it to the second baseman, you can see Rhys Hoskins is in frame and he's about to get big on him like a bear and then drop down to make it hard. And McNeil just comes into frame now and has no interest in playing competitive baseball on this play, just gives himself up and makes it easy. </p>
                    <p>I was like, that's crazy. Then I wanted to make sure people didn't think I was cherry-picking a bajillion, so I put two Rhys Hoskins on the right and eight McNeil on the left, and again, this point where the blue marker is on my timeline is when the bat hits the ball. </p>
        <!-- comparison video plays again -->
                    <p>And if you watch through to when Rhys gets to the bag he's by the cut on the two on the right already and McNeil is nowhere in frame on the bottom four and on the top four he's going down already and not really trying to break it up. </p>
                    <p>That blew me away, man. What's going on here? Is this just a McNeil thing? Is this a Mets thing? Is this an around-the-league thing? Like what is this? Again, I sent videos to some players that I know and talk to and they were like, “What? That is crazy, what is going on?” They’re like, “Rhys looks normal, that's what you're supposed to do.”</p>

                    <p>Then I had to dig deeper because I was watching the Mets game last night and Lindor, on a double play ball, ran through the bag. And then the announcers kind of talked about the strategy to that. It was a double play to end the first inning. Lindor just runs through the bag and they explain why here.</p>
